			<h2><strong>Port Hueneme</strong></h2> 
			<p>Is a small beach city in Ventura County,
			California surrounded by the city of Oxnard,
			Naval Base Ventura County, Point Mugu Naval Base and the Pacific Ocean.
			The name derives from the Spanish spelling of the Chumash wene me,
			meaning <em>"Resting Place"</em>. Juan Rodriguez Cabrillo discovered the area
			in the mid 16th century. The settlement's name was officially changed
			to <strong>Port Hueneme</strong> in 1939 and was incorporated March 24, 1948.
			The population was 21,723 at the 2010 census, down from 21,845
			at the 2000 census. Port Hueneme has a south-facing sand beach,
			known for its surfing. The beach stretches eastward about a mile
			from the harbor and the naval base and includes a wooden fishing pier.</p>
			
			<h2><strong>The Port</strong></h2>
			<p>The Port of Hueneme, shared with Oxnard Harbor District and the
			Naval Base Ventura County, is the only deep water port between the
			Port of Los Angeles and the Port of San Francisco, and the only Navy
			controlled harbor between San Diego Bay and Puget Sound in Washington state.</p>
			<h2><strong>The Harbor</strong></h2>
			<p>The harbor is a shipping and receiving point for a wide variety
			of goods destined for the Los Angeles Basin and beyond, including
			automobiles, pineapples, and bananas. Agricultural products such as
			onions, strawberries, and flowers are shipped.</p>
